Dear Students,
In today’s lesson, we’ll go deeper into HTML (HyperText Markup Language). This is the foundation of every website.

📚 Theory
1. What is HTML?

HTML gives structure to a webpage.

Think of it as the skeleton of a website.

It uses tags written inside < > to tell the browser what to display.

2. Common HTML Tags You Must Know

<!DOCTYPE html> → Tells the browser this is an HTML5 document.

<html> → The root of the page.

<head> → Info about the page (title, links to CSS, metadata).

<title> → Title shown in the browser tab.

<body> → Everything visible on the page.

<h1> … <h6> → Headings (from biggest to smallest).

<p> → Paragraph.

<a> → Link.

<img> → Image.

<ul>, <ol>, <li> → Lists (unordered/bulleted, ordered/numbered).

<div> → A container/section.

🔧 Practical
Step 1: Create a New Project

Create a folder called class2-html.

Inside, create a file called index.html.

Paste this code:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Class 2 - HTML Basics</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to Class 2</h1>
  <p>This is a simple paragraph.</p>

  <h2>My Favorite Fruits</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Mango</li>
    <li>Banana</li>
    <li>Apple</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Visit a Website</h2>
  <p>Click here to go to 
    <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>My First Image</h2>
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="Placeholder Image">
</body>
</html>

Step 2: Run It

Open with Live Server in VS Code.

Try clicking the Google link.

See the list and image appear.

📝 Practice Task

Add your name in an <h1> heading.

Create a list of your 3 favorite foods.

Add a link to any website of your choice.

Try changing the image URL to another picture (maybe from Google Images).

💡 Tip: Don’t try to memorize all tags at once. Use them in small projects and they’ll stick.

🚀 Next class, we’ll move into HTML Forms (how to collect input from users).
